The ODE unit is in charge of solving ODEs, 
it stores the routines necessary to do so,
as well as simulation variables (such as ode_dt_suggested)
that monitor the solution as it evolves.

So far, the Burlisch-Stuer method is the one that 
has a fully implemented adaptative time step, 
this is the routine that should be used.

The RG4 currently has no adaptative step size,
care should be taken when using it.
